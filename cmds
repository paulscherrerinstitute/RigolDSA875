RIGOLO DS875

1) Setup 1,2,3 traces
:TRAC<n>:MODE <WRITe,MAXHold,MINHold,VIEW,BLANk,VIDeoavg,POWavg>

Trace 4 is math operation trace (can only be set using other 3 traces)
-> Will not be supported currently!

2) Get trace(s)
:TRAC:DATA? <TRACE1,TRACE2,TRACE3,TRACE4>

3) Frequency
:SENS:FREQ:CENT <freq_in_hz>  # 0 GHz to 7.5 Ghz
:SENS:FREQ:OFFS <freq_in_hz>  # -100 GHz to 100 GHz
// also way to settup span
:SENS:FREQ:STAR <freq_in_hz>  # 0 GHz to 7.5 Ghz
:SENS:FREQ:STOP <freq_in_hz>  # 0 GHz to 7.5 Ghz

4) Span
:SENS:FREQ:SPAN?
:SENS:FREQ:SPAN <freq_in_hz>  # 0 GHz to 7.5 Ghz
:SENS:FREQ:SPAN:FULL
:SENS:FREQ:SPAN:PREV
:SENS:FREQ:SPAN:ZIN
:SENS:FREQ:SPAN:ZOUT

5) Amplitude
reference level and scale/div are Y axis display manegemt (range of Y axis) does not effect sent data no need to integration

Ref offset ... effects sent data ...but probably more sensible to again use the function on client (caqtdm) side.
in case of SCPI: :DISP:WIN:TRACE:Y:SCAL:RLEV:OFFS

6) Max frequencies searches
I have tired to use peaks table which can be read from the device using:
:TRAC:MATH:PEAK:TABL:STAT 1
:TRAC:MATH:PEAK:DATA?

7) Bandwidth
RBW, VBW and SWE (sweep time) commands added

This approach should provide user with up to 10 peaks on trace 1 without any configuration. However it showed up that RIGOL DSA875 has a possible problems that in majority cases this command freezes the communication over LAN.

Second approach is to support markers (4 are provided)

Options:
- Enable continuous peak search
:CALC:MARK1:CPE // I guess this should be 1
- select max peak
:CALC:MARK1:MAX:MAX
- slect left from current
:CALC:MARK1:MAX:LEFT
- select RIGHT from curretn
:CALC:MARK1:MAX:RIGH
- clear (disable) marker
:CALC:MARK1:STAT 0
- read marker frquency
:CALC:MARK1:X?
- read marker amplitude
:CALC:MARK1:Y?

- Set marker to specified trace
:CALC:MARK1:TRAC 1
- Get current trace
:CALC:MARK1:TRAC?  //Rigold does not work with this (same as mode)
